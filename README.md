# HCNNG
This is the implementation of the Hierarquical Clustering-based Nearest Neighbor Graphs.

- Files containing the dataset feature vectors (for index construction) need to be in the format of binary ".fvecs" files.
- Files containing the test set feature vectors (the queries) need to be in the format of binary ".fvecs" files.
- Files containing the ground truth of queries need to be in the format of binary ".ivecs" files.
