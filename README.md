# HCNNG
This is the implementation of the Hierarquical Clustering-based Nearest Neighbors Graphs. There are two principal files:

- *hcnng.cpp*: this files creates the graph-based index.
- 

The input files format are:

- Files containing the dataset feature vectors (for index construction) need to be in the format of binary ".fvecs" files.
- Files containing the test set feature vectors (the queries) need to be in the format of binary ".fvecs" files.
- Files containing the ground truth of queries need to be in the format of binary ".ivecs" files.
